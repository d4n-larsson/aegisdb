# Set up AegisDB memory for this project

Your job is to wire AegisDB in as this project's persistent memory by gathering a
few settings and then running the `aegisdb-init` scaffolder. Do **not** hand-edit
`.mcp.json` or `.claude/settings.json` yourself — `aegisdb-init` writes them
correctly and idempotently. Keep the conversation short.

## 1. Gather the settings

Ask the user these questions (offer the defaults; accept "just use defaults").
If they passed arguments, treat `$0` as the host and `$1` as the port.

1. **Where is the server?**
   - *Local, and I need one* → you'll start one in step 2.
   - *Local, already running* → host `127.0.0.1`, port `9470`.
   - *Shared / team server* → ask for the host and port, and the **auth token**
     they were given. (With a namespaced token they do **not** need a namespace.)
2. **Embeddings** (controls semantic recall; the dimension MUST match the
   server's `--embedding-dim`):
   - `none` (default) — tag/time recall only, no setup.
   - `voyage` — best recall; dimension `1024`; needs `VOYAGE_API_KEY` in the
     environment.
   - `local` — offline; dimension `384`; downloads a model on first use.
3. **Capture quality** (how finished sessions become memories):
   - `none` (default) — heuristic: keep salient sentences from the transcript.
   - `claude-code` — distil the session into durable facts with an LLM (dedup +
     supersede contradictions on write), reusing the local `claude` CLI auth —
     **no API key needed**. Best quality; recommended if they have the CLI.
   - `anthropic` / `openai` — same, via API; needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
     `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment the hook runs in (never written to the
     project). Only offer these if they can't use the `claude` CLI.
4. **Namespace** — only if they are *not* using a namespaced auth token. Default:
   derive from the project directory.

## 2. (Only if they need a local server) let the scaffolder start one

If they chose "local, and I need one", don't hand them a `docker run` — add
`--start-local` to the commands in step 3. It starts a named container
(`aegisdb`) on a named volume (`aegis-data`), waits until the server actually
answers, adopts an existing `aegisdb` container instead of racing it, and then
reads the embedding dimension back from it so nobody has to type one.

If they don't have Docker, it says so and prints the command to run by hand. If
they want auth/encryption/quotas, point them at the
[team server tutorial](https://github.com/d4n-larsson/aegisdb/blob/main/docs/tutorial-team-server.md)
and continue — `aegisdb-init` can still write the config now.

## 3. Preview, then scaffold

First show what will be written (this changes nothing):

```bash
uvx --from aegisdb-mcp aegisdb-init --print \
  --host <HOST> --port <PORT> --embedding-mode <MODE> \
  [--extract-mode <EXTRACT>] [--namespace <NS>] [--auth-token <TOKEN>]
```

If it looks right, run it for real (drop `--print`, add `--yes`; add `--force`
only if it reports an existing, different `memory` server you want to replace,
and `--start-local` if they need a server started):

```bash
uvx --from aegisdb-mcp aegisdb-init --yes [--start-local] \
  --host <HOST> --port <PORT> --embedding-mode <MODE> \
  [--extract-mode <EXTRACT>] [--namespace <NS>] [--auth-token <TOKEN>]
```

Omit `--extract-mode`/`--namespace`/`--auth-token` when they're blank/`none`.

**Do not pass `--embedding-dim`** unless they insist on a specific number: the
scaffolder asks the server for its own and writes that, which is the only value
that can be right. A number typed from memory is one that can disagree with
`--embedding-dim` on the server, and a mismatch does not surface until the first
embedded write is refused.

## 4. Check it, then wrap up

Run the doctor — it checks every link, not just connectivity, and each failure
names its fix:

```bash
uvx --from aegisdb-mcp aegisdb-doctor
```

Then report what was written and tell the user to **restart Claude Code in this
project** so it picks up the `memory` MCP server and the recall/capture hooks.
(The hook and MCP-entry checks read files on disk, so they pass before the
restart; the restart is what makes Claude Code *use* them.) `/aegis-doctor`
re-runs this any time recall looks wrong.

Optionally point them at the **memory inspector** — a local browser UI to
browse/search what's been captured, see why each hit ranked, and edit or delete
memories: `docker compose --profile inspector up` (then <http://127.0.0.1:8600/>),
or `make inspector` from a clone.
